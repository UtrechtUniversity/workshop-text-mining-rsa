    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome\nText mining methods are quickly gaining popularity among researchers, including those from Law, Economics and Governance (LEG) disciplines. Text mining exploits sizeable collections of digitized texts for automatic analysis, using software such as R or Python. For example, newspaper articles have been to measure economic sentiments and digitized court records to analyze the evolution of jurisdiction.\nIn this course, we will get you up to speed with a simple workflow for data-driven research using digitized text collections, and learn to reflect on the pros and cons of using methods like these. We will start with selecting relevant texts in iAnalyzer and creating a dataset based on your own research question. After an introduction to R, you will gradually learn to analyze your dataset. This also allows you to develop general skills in R that are becoming ever more useful in the complex analysis of data. By the end of the course, you will be able to answer a simple research question based on your dataset, and to use an ‘Open Science’ approach to report on your workflow and the pros and cons of text-mining.\nAfter completing this module, students will be able to:\n\nprocess substantial datasets containing textual information;\nselect subsets of digitized text collections such as newspapers for analysis;\nimport and harmonize textual data in R;\nvisualize textual data using n-grams and relations between words;\nautomatically identify themes and subjects within textual data (topic modeling);\nreflect on the benefits and drawbacks of using text-mining methods for research."

    "text": "The course consists of 5 instructional meetings. Each meeting involves some preparation beforehand and homework afterwards. The preparation and homework will be necessary to ensure an efficient use of lesson time and you will be building up your final assignment as you go.\nAs you progress through the course, you can reach out to the instructors during the Walk-In Hours of Research Data Management Support with any questions or issues. The Walk-In Hours take place every Monday from 15:00 to 17:00 at the University Library in the Science Park. However, one instructor will be available at the University Library in the city center (in the seating area near the Digital Humanities Lab) and you are welcome free to request a meeting online (via MS Teams) during these hours as well.\nYou can also contact the course coordinator, Neha Moopen, by email at n.moopen@uu.nl\n\nMeeting 1Meeting 2Meeting 3Meeting 4Meeting 5\n\n\nIn this meeting, we will introduce students to I-Analyzer. I-Analyzer is an online text and data mining application developed by the Digital Humanities Lab at Utrecht University. We will work on the Times Newspapers corpus in iAnalyzer.\nWe will then proceed with exploring how you can process the corpora in I-Analyzer. This will include:\n\nSearching and filtering the corpus, as well as visualizing the results.\nCreating subsets of the data (corpus) and exporting it for further analysis in R.\n\nHomework\n\nComplete the exercise started in class.\nConduct a new query in I-Analyzer and export the results.\n\n\n\nPreparation\n\nInstall R & RStudio.\nWatch a video introducing R & RStudio.\n\nSession\nThe day of the course will be an introduction to R. This will include:\n\nR Syntax & Data Types\nVectors in R\nData Structures\nMissing Data\nIndexing Vectors & Lists\nIndexing a Data Frame\n\nNote that we do not cover programming techniques such as if statements, functions, loops. The aim of this session is to familiarize students with R and present some basic data wrangling operations.\nHomework\n\nComplete the Base R exercises started in class.\n\n\n\nPreparation\nReview recommended literature and provide a small presentation (possibly in groups) on selected papers.\nSession\nThis meeting will start off with a guest lecture from prof. dr. Femke van Esch who is based at the Utrecht School of Governance. The topic will not be text mining in and of itself, but a broader discussion of the opportunities provided by computational methods and techniques in LEG disciplines.\nThereafter, we will will dive into the presentations and discussion of literature. The final assignment includes a reflection assignment, the discussion here can provide a basis for that.\nHomework\nMake a start on your reflection assignment with some rough notes.\n\n\nPreparation\n\nInstall the necessary packages required for the TidyText session: tidyverse & tidytext\nCreate a folder structure for the next session, place the necessary files in the appropriate locations.\n\nSession\nThe meeting is where we will dive into text-mining with R. This will include:\n\nimporting and tidying textual data in R (tidy text format)\nsentiment analysis\nanalyzing word and document frequency (tf-idf)\ncalculating and visualizing relationships between words (n-grams and correlations)\nidentifying themes and subjects within textual data (topic modeling)\n\nHomework\n\nComplete the text mining exercises in R that we started during the session. If you get stuck, the instructors are available for help on Mondays from 15:00-17:00 either online or at the University Library in the City Center.\n\n\n\nPreparation\n\nFinalize your research question and dataset for final assignment, if you haven’t done so already.\nWatch a video on R Markdown.\n\nSession\nStudents will have already been working in R Markdown documents for Day 2 & Day 3, but we will take a step further to add prose/text between the code and ‘knit’ or render the R Markdown file to pdf or HTML. This is a fully reproducible workflow which weaves together text, code, results into one output file.\nThe resulting text-mining report can be eventually be submitted for grading, along with the reflection report.\nHomework\nWork on the final assignment.\n\n\n\nIn additional to the 5 instructional meetings, we can reserve an optional meeting(s) 6 & 7 in case they are required to refresh some concepts or if additional support is required for the assignments. This can be decided with the students and instructors as we go through the course."

When placed after a term this signifies how many characters are allowed to differ. So bank~1 also matches bang, sank, dank etc. When placed after a phrase, this signifies how many words may differ\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation OCR scores\nOCR stands for “Optical character recognition” and it is a key tool for text mining. OCR uses machine learning to extract words and lines of text from scans and images, which can then be used to perform quantitative text analysis or natural language processing.As you can imagine, dependent on the image/scan quality, the writing (machine vs. hand-written) etc., the automated recognition of characters will not be perfect. The OCR score is a metric used to quantify the accuracy of the text extraction (in other words, the score reflects how likely it is that there are errors in the text extraction)"

    "text": "Install & Load Packages\nLet’s be sure you have all the needed packages installed and that loading them into RStudio works fine.\nThese are two distinct operations: installing means downloading and installing all the files related to a package in your computer and this is usually a one-time operation, while loading a package means making the package’s functions and other features ready to be used in your R session.\nThe latter is something you need to do every time you start (or re-start) your R session. To install and load packages we use the R functions install.packages() and library(), respectively. Remember that install.packages() requires its arguments to be specified between double quotes, while library() accepts both double quotes or the plain name of the package.\nLet’s install the packages:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidytext\")\ninstall.packages(\"wordcloud\")\n\nAnd load them:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\n\nA few words about the packages we are going to use:\n\n\ntidyverse: this is an “opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures”. Among the many tidyverse packages, we are going to use in particular:\n\n\nreadr: allowing to read data from files;\n\n\ndplyr: providing tools for data manipulation;\n\n\ntidyr: providing tools to make your data “tidy”;\n\n\nforcats: providing tools to solve problems with factors, and advanced R topic we would not spend much time talking about;\n\n\nggplot2: a system for creating graphics.\n\n\n\ntidytext: an R package for text mining based on the tidy data principles;\n\n\nwordcloud: a package to generate word cloud plots."
