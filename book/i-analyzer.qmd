# Text Mining with iAnalyzer

iAnalyzer is a Webpage-based GUI for searching through / querying text corpora.

We will use it today in the exercises in order to perform a search in the available text corpora and download the result (in the form of a CSV file), which you will use in the next session for further analysis in R.

## Cheatsheet for Search Queries

Operator    Description     Example/Explanation
--------   --------------   ----------------
+           means AND       bank +assets
|           means OR        bank |assets -> Note that OR is already the default way to combine search terms, so "bank assets" would be sufficient in this example.
-           means NOT       bank -assets
" "         entire phrase   allows the search for an entire phrase: “the assets of the bank”
*	          wildcard        A wildcard for any number of characters, e.g. bank* will match banking, banks, banked, etc. The wildcard is only allowed at the end of a word, and cannot be used with phrases (between " quotes).
~N         fuzzy search     Describes fuzzy search. When placed after a term this signifies how many characters are allowed to differ. So bank~1 also matches bang, sank, dank etc. When placed after a phrase, this signifies how many words may differ
