# Lecture & Literature {.unnumbered}

## Literature Discussion

1. Get into subgroups where all the LEG disciplines are represented.

2. Present your slides summarizing literature from your discipline to others in your groups.

## Reflection

Consider the following questions when reflecting on the literature (across disciplines):

- What stood out to you in the literature? What did you notice that was really interesting or worthwhile to mention?

- What were the concepts or techniques that you did not fully understand?

- How can text-mining help you understand important quetions in LEG disciplines? What does it add to the method and techniques that are currently in use?

- If you were able to analyze all text eveywhere in your discipline, what would you be interested in learning?
