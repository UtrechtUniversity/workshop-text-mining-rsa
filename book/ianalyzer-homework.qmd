# Homework {.unnumbered}

As homework, you are required to:

**1. Complete the I-Analyzer exercise conducted during the session.**

_This is if you didn't already finish it during the meeting._ 
You will be required to show the exported dataset as part of the grading of the course.

**2. Create your own text mining dataset using I-Analyzer.**

This exercise will form the basis of your final assignment. 

- Think about a research question you would like to answer using the _Times Newspapers_ corpus in I-Analyzer.

- Construct a query in line with your research question and document it for reference and reproducibility. You can refer to the cheatsheet for building search queries on the previous page. 

- Run the query in I-Analyzer.

- Export the results as a csv file and save it in an accessible location.
