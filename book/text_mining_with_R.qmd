### Introduction

In this session we will see how to perform basic **text mining** with R. As the word
itself suggests, text mining refers to the process of extracting information and insights
from text. Text mining can be extremely useful when looking for any sort of pattern,
trend, or relantionships in large volumes of text data (articles, documents, emails, 
social media posts, etc).<br>
Text mining, or text analysis, can be a very challenging task as text data is often
*unstructured*, i.e. it does not have a predefined format or structure. Furthermore, 
text is written in natural language and contains all the ambiguity of human
subjects. Considering that everything ever written is text, the volume of data available for 
mining is huge and very "noisy", as text may contain irrelevant information, typos, etc.
For these reasons, text mining requires quite sophisticated techniques to be perfomed.<br>
Thanks for us, most of these techniques have already been implemented into ready-to-use
packages in different programming languanges (including R) and in this session we will go through the basic steps of a general text mining process:
data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, text classification, and visualization.
