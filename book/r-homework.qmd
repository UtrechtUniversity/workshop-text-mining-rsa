# Homework {.unnumbered}

As homework, you are required to:

**1. Complete the Base R exercises conducted during the session.**

This is if you didn't already finish it during the meeting. 
You will be required to show the completed exercises as part of the grading of the course.

Use the videos and slides as a reference for completing the exercises. If you get stuck, you can reach out to the instructors on Mondays between 15:00-17:00 either online or at the University Library in the City Center.
